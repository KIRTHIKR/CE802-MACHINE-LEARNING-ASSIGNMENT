# CODE 1
# Data Setup and Exploration:

Loaded the training data and checked for any missing values.

# Data Cleaning:

Removed columns with missing data to ensure a clean dataset for analysis.

# Correlation Analysis:

Explored relationships between features by visualizing a correlation matrix.

# Handling Missing Values:

Imputed missing values using the average, ensuring completeness for further analysis.

# Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest models, assessing their predictive accuracy.

# Optimizing Model Performance:

Used GridSearchCV to find the best settings for a Gradient Boosting Machine model.

# Model Comparison:

Compared the performance of different models using a heatmap visualization.

# Test Data Prediction:

Applied the trained model to predict outcomes on a separate test dataset.

# Conclusion:

Concluded the process by reiterating key steps and notifying the successful generation of the output file.
